## Requirements
- Works with Windows, Linux and Mac
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.0 or greater
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


## Installation
1. Go to the folder where you want to store Cert-Gen.
1. Open the commandline from the chosen folder.
1. Write the following command on the commandline:<br/> ```git clone https://github.com/Biowulf21/Cert-Gen.git```
1. Voil√†, you know have a copy of the program!


## Use-Cases
Cert-Gen is primarily used in the following use-cases:
- Certificate Generation and Sending
- Receipt Generation and Sending


__Note: Cert-Gen can be used in conjunction with any task that requires the names of multiple people on the same document and for that document to be sent to their respective emails.__
## Limitations
- As of the moment, Cert-Gen does not have a way to confirm if the email has been successfully sent. However, this can be checked in the email sentbox.
  
- At this point in time, a graphical user interface __(GUI)__ has __NOT__ been designed (as this script was just written as a quick way to send certificates to emails)

- I will be working on making Cert-Gen an excecutable file ~~as I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to make that work with Python~~ for easier installation.
## Usage
1. Download all necessary files and dependencies from steps above.
1. Input the names of the receipients on column A and their emails on column B. Make sure the emails are aligned respectively.
1. Make sure to __save__ the names.xlsx file. This is important as the program will only detect the values inputted in the worksheet when it is saved.
__Note:__ The data in the sheet should have no blank cells in between. Though this won't cause any crashes, the program will use a None value to create a certificate and send it to an 'None' email.
1. Open the commandline from the folder where Cert-Gen is located at.
### On Windows:
	1. Open the folder where Cert-Gen is.
	1. Right click on any blank space in the file manager.
	1. Click on 'Open in terminal'
1. Run the command ```python3 certificate.py```
1. You should now see the program generate the certificates and send them to their respective emails :)
# FAQs
- __Q:__ Does this program have a Graphical User Interface? <br/>
__A:__ No, a GUI is definitely planned, but right now it's commandline only. It's very easy to use, though.
