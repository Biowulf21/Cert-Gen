## Requirements
- Works with Windows, Linux and Mac
- Python 3.0 or greater
- Git (version control system)
## Installation
1. Go to the folder where you want to store Cert-Gen.
1. Open the commandline from the chosen folder.
1. Write the following command on the commandline:<br/> ```git clone https://github.com/Biowulf21/Cert-Gen.git```
1. Voil√†, you know have a copy of the program!
## Use-Cases
Cert-Gen is primarily used in the following use-cases:
- Certificate Generation and Sending
- Receipt Generation and Sending


__Note: Cert-Gen can be used in conjunction with any task that requires the names of multiple people on the same document and for that document to be sent to their respective emails.__
## Limitations
- As of the moment, Cert-Gen does not have a way to confirm if the email has been successfully sent. However, this can be checked in the email sentbox.
  
- At this point in time, a graphical user interface __(GUI)__ has __NOT__ been designed (as this script was just written as a quick way to send certificates to emails)

- I will be working on making Cert-Gen an excecutable file ~~as I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to make that work with Python~~ for easier installation.
